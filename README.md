1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2

    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> are supported
- [x] list syntax is required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
